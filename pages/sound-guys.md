My first solo, independently developed game, Sound Guys blends an incremental/idle game with a music sequencer. In the game you collect guys, place them into a looping music sequencer, gain notes and then spend those notes on more guys! The project took me roughly 6 months to complete and was accepted to be showcased in the Leftfield Collection at EGX in 2024.
