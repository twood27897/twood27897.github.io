## Blogs
I consider these <i>"blogs"</i> more as notes on a variety of technical things I've done or looked at, allowing me to record and explore ideas smaller than personal projects. The first two blogs are the first two entries I originally wrote for my portfolio - which I discarded in favour of much shorter entries - but now they have found a new home here.<br>
