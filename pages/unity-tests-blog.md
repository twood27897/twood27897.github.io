<p align="center">
  After spending time being introduced to and writing unit tests and testable code in UE4 at Rare, 
  I thought I would explore the testing framework of the engine I use the most at home - Unity. I picked
  a small scene with some scripts in it that I had written with no intention to test and got to writing a 
  few tests in it while learning what Unity's test framework had to offer.
