The Whale Game is a project I created to push my game development skills. A 3D puzzle room centred on a 2D incremental game, The Whale Game required me to design a 2D and a 3D game and balance the players attention and motivation between them. I finished the first act of the game over a 6 month period, which you can play now for free.
