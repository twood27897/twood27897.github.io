## About Me

Currently in third year of Computer Games Technology at Abertay University. Learning, making and playing while gaining experience with C++, DirectX, C#, SQL, OpenGL, SFML, Python and more. Maintaining an A grade average across all modules and continually improving and gaining confidence.

Developing games whenever I can independently and in teams. Using tools including Unity, Unreal Engine and GameMaker: Studio as well as tiny tools like Bitsy, PuzzleScript and Bravitzlana. Took part in DARE Academy 2018 as one of two programmers on the game Sketchtown Showdown - which we showcased at EGX. Created and released Shape Arcade on the Google Play Store during my first summer of university as a solo project, and have continued to work on solo projects since then. Leading micro game jams as a part of Abertay Game Development Society - encouraging people to make more! With show and tell/post-mortem meetings to follow up on what people have done.

Regularly volunteering and enjoying my time by assisting at creative events including Insomnia, NEoN, Raspberyy Pi Jams and AMAZE. Beriln Spent over a year assisting at a Code Club teaching children to code and embrace their creativity - something I relly believe in.
