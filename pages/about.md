## About Me

Working on Everwild - a brand new world in development at Rare where unique and unforgettable experiences will await! Gaining my first AAA industry experience writing C++, writing unit tests, using Perforce. and so much more as part of the gameplay team. Absorbing as much knowledge as I can and learning so so much from everyone around me.

Previously studied Computer Games Technology at Abertay University. Learning, making and playing while gaining experience with C++, DirectX, C#, OpenGL, SFML, Python and more. Averaging an A grade across all modules and continually improving and gaining confidence.

Developing games whenever I can independently and in teams. Using tools such as Unity, Unreal Engine and GameMaker: Studio as well as tiny tools like Bitsy, PuzzleScript and Bravitzlana. Took part in DARE Academy 2018 as one of two programmers on the game Sketchtown Showdown which we showcased at EGX. Created and released my solo game Shape Arcade on the Google Play Store and itch.io along with other personal projects. Leading micro game jams as a part of Abertay Game Development Society - encouraging people to make more! With show and tell/post-mortem meetings to follow up on what people have done.

Regularly volunteering and enjoying my time by assisting at creative events including Insomnia, NEoN, Raspberry Pi Jams and AMAZE. Berlin. Assisting at a code club teaching children to code and embrace their creativity.
