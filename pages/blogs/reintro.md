<p align="center">
  As of today, sometime, somewhere, September 2025, it's been almost 2 years since I left my job at Xbox's Rare, programming video games and getting paid for it. Since then, I've been working on various personal projects, spending time with friends and family, eating, sleeping, repeating, enjoying the unprecendented Scottish sun and learning how to live on a budget - or doing what the kids might call "programming video games and not getting paid for it". Why? Chalk it up to the allure of instant noodles and a shoestring budget. Or more seriously, being ~7 years into making games and wanting to challenge myself. Take off the training wheels and see if I could make a game completely on my own. I'd been a games programmer as part of a large team and wanted to understand more about the other ingredients (design, art, audio etc) that make up the big tasty pie (video games). While it might have been wiser to attempt this learning process by getting a job at a smaller company or making small games in my spare time, I decided to opt for the no holds barred experience of leaving my job and starting out completely on my own, not sure what to make or what I would do with it. <br/><br/>

  Now, I find myself further along than I expected to be honest. <a href="https://twood27897.github.io/pages/sound-guys.html">Sound Guys</a> is a small game I made and released last year (~2 hours playtime). A gamified music sequencer that lets anyone collect sounds and make music, it was selected to be featured in the Leftfield Collection at EGX 2024 alongside it's free release on itch.io. <a href="https://twood27897.github.io/pages/whale-game.html">The Whale Game</a> is a game I've been working on and will release the first act of this year - it's bigger than anything I've attempted to make on my own before and has pushed me creatively and technically. <br/><br/>
  
  Alongside those two larger projects, I experimented a lot. I made smaller games and prototypes of big ideas and had a lot of fun doing it! I learned more about myself, where my strengths sit and where my weaknesses hide. I've grown more confident in my design and technical skills - bringing ideas to life and creating a player experience from the ground up is something I'm good at. Solving hard problems while creating games brings me a good bit of joy. At the same time, I've realised I don't take naturally to putting myself out there. Currently, I find marketing myself and what I make hard. Although I want to grow to be better at it, for now I've got a long way to go. All in all, this translates to the last 2 years being super fruitful, but the figurative train now needing to pull back into a figurative station (read as "It's been a lot of fun but now it's time to figure out paying the bills"). <br/><br/>

  So, what's next? I'm not sure! Or I am sure, but only of some of it (a condition that I hear is suffered by many). I am sure:
  1. I want to make more games
  2. I want to work as part of a team<br/><br/>

I am not sure:
1. What games I want to make
2. Who I want to make them with<br/><br/>

In the meantime, I've decided I'm going to write some blogs (like this one!). Start documenting what I've been up to, collect my thoughts, puzzle through some design/programming and build up to finding the game and team that's next. And I'll probably make some more stuff while I'm doing it.<br/><br/>
