  When I started making <a href="https://twood27897.github.io/pages/whale-game.html">The Whale Game</a> I knew I wanted to have characters speak to the player, saying things like "EXPOSITION!" and "Here's a hint at what you, the almighty player, should do next!". I wanted dialog! An issue I have, however, with the way dialog is displayed in a lot of games is that it only exists in a static, boring UI overlay/window. A box pops up at the bottom of the screen to click through with text detailing what is being said and as you hit whatever button is necessary to skip through the boxes you feel less like you are talking to someone and more like you just want to get it over and done with and get back to the gameplay. With that in mind, I wanted to take a different approach to displaying the dialog in my game. One that felt more fun. And that didn't immediately remind me of all the other times I'd been playing a game and had to wade through static boxes clogging up the bottom half of my screen. Introducing the Dynamic Dialog Display! In this blog, I am going to briefly describe what the Dynamic Dialog Display is and then get into some of the code I wrote to implement it. Buckle in...

  Luckily, I am by no means the first to approach displaying dialog in a video game in a more dynamic way. Speech bubble-like displays can be found in games like <i>A Short Hike</i> or <i>Oxenfree</i> for example.
