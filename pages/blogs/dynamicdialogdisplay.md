  When I started making <a href="https://twood27897.github.io/pages/whale-game.html">The Whale Game</a> I knew I wanted to have characters speak to the player, saying things like "EXPOSITION!" and "Here's a hint at what you, the player, should do next!". I wanted dialog! An issue I have, however, with the way dialog is displayed in a lot of games is that it only exists in a UI overlay/window. A box pops up at the bottom of the screen for the player to click through, with text detailing what is being said. I dislike this kind of dialog display because I have seen it so many times and in many contexts the dialog it contained wasn't interesting or didn't give me any new information. I skipped the dialog at the bottom of the screen in previous games. And now, I'm more likely to skip straight through the dialog in other games too.
