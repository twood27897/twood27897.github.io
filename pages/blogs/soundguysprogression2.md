  In <a href="https://twood27897.github.io/pages/sound-guys.html">Sound Guys</a>, I always wanted the game to be structured with the "watch big number go up exponentially" mantra of an idle/incremental game - for the player to start with very little and (with a satisfyingly quick pace) gain more and more and more over time. Two challenges presented themselves pretty quickly however. One, in balancing the cost of buying new guys vs how much they gave back so that players chased the carrot on the stick of collecting and placing new sound guys. And then two, in keeping the player created song(s) sounding good-ish once they were chasing the carrot on the stick and were incentivised to keep acquiring and adding more and more guys. In this blog I want to cover how I tackled these problems and reflect on what went well (and what, well, didn't!).<br/><br/>

  <b><i>2. Keeping Everything Sounding Good</i></b><br/><br/>
  Now that players enjoyed the process of building their collection of guys, a new problem presented itself. How do you keep a piece of music sounding good when the person making it is being incentivised by a nefarious game developer to keep adding more and more notes to it till it sound like a piano falling down a flight of stairs? Well, your first thought might be to lock the game dev up and throw away the key - but what if the game dev is you? And what if you don't like being locked up? That was the problem I faced. So what did I do? Designed some solutions! And then picked some solutions!<br/><br/>
