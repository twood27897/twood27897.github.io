  If you have not yet read my blog <a href="https://twood27897.github.io/pages/blogs/soundguysprogression.md">Progression in Sound Guys #1</a>, I highly recommend going and reading it before continuing on here. If you have already read the previous blog (or have decided not to heed my warning at your own peril!) here is me writing about keeping player created song(s) sounding good-ish in Sound Guys even after they were incentivised to keep acquiring and adding more and more guys to their playspace.<br/><br/>

  <b><i>Keeping Everything Sounding Good</i></b><br/><br/>
  How do you keep a piece of music sounding good when the person making it is being incentivised by a nefarious game developer to keep adding more and more notes to it till it sounds like a piano falling down a flight of stairs? Well, your first thought might be to lock the game dev up and throw away the key - but what if the game dev is you? And what if you don't like being locked up? That was the problem I faced. So what did I do? Designed some solutions of course! Nice!<br/><br/>

  The real centre of this problem is that, in Sound Guys, the composer (aka the player) is not motivated by wanting to create a song. They want to play a game, have fun, collect guys, build up a horde of notes and maybe make a song along the way. The player will keep playing the game, collecting guys and building up a horde of notes even if that means making a song that is unlistenable and sounds bad. After all, they can just mute the game and put on Netflix in the background. This presented itself early on in Sound Guys development. Players would fill up as much of their sequencer grid as possible with guys, meaning there were no rests in the music and every beat always had multiple layers of notes playing. It sounded bad. But players were maximising their earnings! They were playing in an optimised fashion and making sure they could collect more guys and build up a horde of notes as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>

  <i>Adding a Cap.</i><br/>
  So, a very clear solution is to limit the number of guys a player can place in their playspace. Instead of letting players fill all 32 slots in their music sequencer grid, cap them at filling 16 slots at a time. Now, there is space in the music and it is allowed to breathe. It sounds better for it. But wait, this approach does come with its own problems. Some players find arbitrary limitations frustrating. If a player can see empty slots and has guys to place in them, why can't they? Just because of a number cap above the grid? That can be annoying! This frustration impacts more players and grows the harsher the cap is. Imagine if there were 32 slots but you could only place 4 guys at once? Not nice! We are left with a double edged sword. A way to directly stop players from overfilling the song they are creating with notes, but also an element of the game that could cause serious frustration.<br/><br/>

  <i>Expanding the Grid.</i><br/>
  Another option for stopping players overfilling their music is to give them more music to create. By expanding the playspace, players have more room to fill and less chance of overfilling it. With each expansion the player needs more guys to fill up the room they now have. If the balance of obtaining guys and expanding the playspace match correctly, players will always have room to fill and just enough enough guys to fill it. This approach does not entirely solve the overfilling problem on its own. The player also needs to be incentivised to engage with the new space and not just keep placing all their guys in the starting area. Applying a multiplier to all guys placed in the new area can bring this incentive. As the player expands the area to place new guys, they find an opportunity to multiply earnings. Forever expanding a looping grid, however, is not the best idea. The wait for the highest earning section to come around gets longer as the grid grows. A player won't mind waiting for an 8 second long section to go by before their best section is played again but if the player has a grid they have expanded 10 times and has to wait for 10 8 second long sections to go by before their best section is played, they will be less than happy. Another double edged sword, alleviating the overfilling problem slightly but only until the player finishes expanding the grid.<br/><br/>

  <i>Cleaning the Slate.</i><br/>
  Normally when someone is creating a song, they eventually finish it. At some point, they call it enough, listen to it for a while and then often start on another song. In Sound Guys, players aren't really incentivised to finish editing, adding to or taking away from the song they are making. The idea of finishing a section of music, however, could help with players overfilling their playspace. If players eventually stop editing and adding to one section of music and were given a clean slate to start fresh, they could add new guys to their heart's content. Starting and finishing "songs" as they collect new guys. Never overfilling an area as they can move onto another.<br/><br/>

  <i>Combos! Combos! Combos!</i><br/>
  A fourth solution could be to directly incentivise the player to place guys in a manner that sounds good. Applying simple patterns and rhythms that tame the chaos of placing guys down semi-randomly. Players could learn these patterns over time, and when placing guys to match them, they could be rewarded with higher earnings. Three of the same guy in a row or two of one type of guy followed by two of another. Each combination can help build a more cohesive and directed piece of music. This solution is pretty clean but limits player expression: if every player uses the same patterns and rhythms their music will be less unique and could feel overly directed to players who are motivated by the creative expression in the game. Perhaps a small price to pay. Definitely feeds into a larger question of balancing opposing player motivations.<br/><br/>

In the end, as with many design challenges, most approaches have pros and cons. And, as with many design challenges, the best approach is multi-faceted. For Sound Guys, I ended up implementing a version of all these solutions to alleviate players overfilling and "piano falling down a flight of stairs-ifying" their music. Balancing the solutions against one another to get the most out of their strengths while minimising their weaknesses. And after all that, one of Sound Guys's larger design challenges is overcome and the game is more fun to play!<br/><br/>
