  In object-oriented programming it is easy to make a mess. Classes can become bloated and reach incomprehensible sizes that would make any software engineer blush. It happens. For real, it happens. To people. Even to people who are writing blogs about it that you are reading right now. While developing my own games, I have largely favoured moving quickly and breaking stuff over writing clean, maintainable, extensible, non-messy code. When working on your own and prototyping ideas this can be a great approach! After all, any time you spend perfecting a system's architecture could be wasted as the design of what you're working on inevitably changes and you throw out that system in favour of something else. Eventually though there comes a time where you know a system is here to stay. For example, I have now used the same interaction system in three of my projects. It is time for me to make the code comprehensible and to do that I am going to apply the SOLID design principles.
