  I've made a fair amount of stuff. Quick experiements, bigger prototypes, small games for friends and family - the digital, interactive entertainment centred, video game creating chaos I am leaving in my wake is sizeable. So, I thought, to try and get a hold of it, I'd document some of my creations here. That way when I undoubtedly forget what I've made, I won't even need to remember. Instead, I'll just read this back.<br/><br/>

  <b><i>Man. Concrete. Fog.</i></b><br/><br/>
  A tiny open world horror game, <i>Man. Concrete. Fog.</i> is pretty much what it says on the tin: you walk around a foggy, concrete environment filled with what look like naked men (thankfully, they're low poly).<br/><br/>

A lot of the learning for me in creating this game was in the open world-ness of it or rather: 1. Giving players a drive for exploration and: 2. Giving players a sense of discovery when exploring. I used the "Kill 10 of X" quest structure to push the player out into the world with a purpose, and then filled the world with diorama-like set pieces that were both interesting to look at but also helped fulfill the "Kill 10 of X" goal. A very simple approach but one that works well for a small game like this. In general, I actually think these principles are the bed rock of the open world game structure: quickly give players a simple goal to drive them out into the world, then reward exporation regularly with interesting set-pieces/characters/progress etc. <i>Breath of the Wild</i> has it's "Destroy Ganon" quest, <i>A Short Hike</i> has you getting to the top of the mountain for cell phone reception. Both push you out into the world with a clear objective, and both make you realise that it's the journey that counts, and actually that thing you thought was super important can wait till later. <i>Man. Concrete. Fog.</i> was a nice exercise, dipping my toes in the water of putting those principles into practice.<br/><br/> 

  <b><i>Pack-A-Thon</i></b><br/><br/>
  A quick prototype, <i>Pack-A-Thon</i> is an exploration of an idea I had for an idle/incremental game where you open packs, collect cards, place those cards on a grid, earn coins and open more packs.<br/><br/>

  Throughout the game, I wanted to parody and reference existing real world card packs and have each one's cards have a unique mechanic for earning coins on the grid. For example, the "Top Trumps" or, in our case, "Got Stumps?" cards would need to be placed from left to right so each card had at least one stat higher than the previous card - only then would it earn coins. On finishing the prototype, I felt the idea had merit but the prototype uncovered a list of friction points that I won't get into here. In the end, this was enough for me to start work on The Whale Game instead.<br/><br/>  

  <b><i>Horror Flat Party Game</i></b><br/><br/>
  Created for a Halloween party me and my flatmates hosted, this was the first time I ever tried to make a horror game. In the cleverly titled <i>Horror Flat Party Game</i>, you are returning to our now haunted Halloween party after you accidently left your keys behind. Oops!<br/><br/>

  Really just an excuse for me to model our real flat, not only did I get a kick out of seeing our physical space recreated digitally, but thankfully so did the people who played. My favourite part of the game was breaking the assumption that the space would stay the same as it is in real life. Spoilers ahead, a door to a new room (that doesn't exist in real life <sup><i>as far as we know...</i></sup>) opens in the walls of the flat and the whole living room turns upside down. Making a game set in a space the player is already familiar with creates unique design opportunities that you can't really get anywhere else!<br/><br/>

  <b><i>Bouncy Box</i></b><br/><br/>
  <i>Bouncy Box</i> is a tiny digital fidget "toy". You click in time with a metronome to bounce a box (who would have thought!) around a small container.<br/><br/>

  From the start, I knew I wanted to experiment with taking away direct score tracking. Removing progression, obstacles or any outlined objectives to create something toy-like rather than game-like. Pretty simple! Once I'd established the basic interaction though, I found there was a lack of momentum. I added a build up of visual feedback as you hit in time with the metronome multiple times in a row. Indirect, but still giving a sense of ebb and flow that makes the toy more engaging to interact with. Maybe I failed in landing the toy-like experience I wanted by adding the stakes/progression of building up and then losing the visual feedback? I'm not sure, you be the judge!<br/><br/>
