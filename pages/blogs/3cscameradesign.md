  <i>"The 3Cs of Game Development"</i> - Character, Controls, Camera. This is a term that I've seen pop up here and there in my years doing game development. Some combination of Character, Controls and Camera usually make up the core interaction system of any video game whether it's a Realtime Stategy Game or a Third Person Shooter. This means The 3Cs are something to nail down early in development. You want to make sure you have a good idea of what the central character(s), controls and camera(s) in your game look like before leaving prototyping and entering production. The <a href="https://pixelatron.com/blog/the-making-of-super-mario-64-full-giles-goddard-interview-ngc/">stories of Mario 64's early development</a> only being concerned with perfecting Mario's controls, camera, animations etc. (and Miyamoto spending 99% of his time on it during development) come to mind. The 3Cs are important! So, with that in mind, I thought I'd spend some time designing and implementing a version of the 3C that I have spent the least amount of time on so far in my development career: the Camera!<br/><br/>
  
  <i>Note: Not only have I seen reference to "The 3Cs of Game Development" but also the 4Cs (Choice, Chance, Change, Challenge). See my blog <a href="https://helloimtw.me/pages/blogs/sela.html">SELA (Software Engineers Love Acronyms)</a> for even more acronym fun! On review, another blog tiled "AGDELA (All Game Developers Everywhere Love Acronyms)" or maybe even "HELA (Humans Everywhere Love Acronyms)" might be in order!</i><br/><br/>
