<p align="center">
In Sound Guys, player progression presented an interesting challenge. From the outset I wanted the game to be structured with the "watch big number go up" mantra of an idle/incremental game - I wanted the player to start with very little and (with a satisfyingly quick pace) gain more notes/sounds/guys over time. Challenges presented themselves, however, in balancing the cost of buying new guys vs how much they gave back and in keeping the player created song(s) sounding good-ish while heavily incentivising them to keep acquiring and adding more sounds.
