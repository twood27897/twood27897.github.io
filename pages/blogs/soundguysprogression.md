  In <a href="https://twood27897.github.io/pages/sound-guys.html">Sound Guys</a>, I knew from the outset I wanted the game to be structured with the "watch big number go up" mantra of an idle/incremental game - I wanted the player to start with very few of these devious sound guys I'd devised and (with a satisfyingly quick pace) gain more of them over time. Two challenges present themselves pretty quickly however. One, in balancing the cost of buying new guys vs how much they gave back so that players chased the carrot on the stick of collecting and placing new sound guys. And then two, in keeping the player created song(s) sounding good-ish once they were chasing the carrot on the stick and were incentivised to keep acquiring and adding more and more sounds. In this blog I want to cover how I tackled these problems and reflect on what went well (and what, well, didn't!).<br/><br/>

<b><i>1. Balancing Cost vs Earnings of Guys</b></i><br/><br/>
  So, to start, how much should sound guys cost/earn? "Easy!", you might say, "Small numbers and then bigger numbers later on", and, to be honest, that isn't far off. But when just guess-timating and semi-randomly assigning costs and earnings, I found I ended up with inconsistent pacing; periods where players flew through buying new guys; but more importantly gaps when players weren't able to afford any new guys for too long and got bored. <br/><br/>
  
  I mean, we can always assume the two numbers are dependent on each other. As a player, we would assume a game element that is valuable costs a lot and vice versa. For Sound Guys, this means a guy that earns a lot should cost a lot and a guy that costs a lot should earn a lot. Cost and earning are proprotional. At this point, math equations can begin to rear their ugly head. <br/><br/>

<b><i>2. Keeping Everything Sounding Good</b></i><br/><br/>
  Now that players enjoyed the process of building a collection of guys, a new problem presented itself. How do you keep a piece of music sounding good when the person making it is being incentivised by a nefarious game developer to keep adding more and more notes to it till it sounds as good as a piano falling down a flight of stairs (which is to say not good at all)? Well, your first thought might be to lock the game dev up and throw away the key - but what if the game dev is you? That was the problem I faced. So what did I do? Designed some solutions!
