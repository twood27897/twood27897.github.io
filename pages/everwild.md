A game by Rare Ltd. that I worked on as a Gameplay Programmer - starting as an intern, gaining responsibility and finishing as a mid-level software engineer. I worked on a variety of gameplay mechanics and systems, prototyping with designers and then taking them into full production. The project has since been cancelled which is sad to see. I really valued my time working on it as I learnt a lot and got to cut my teeth in the AAA games industry.
